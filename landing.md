Before we begin, here are some rules that need to be followed while in the computer lab.

* No food allowed in the lab. This is to keep the computers clean and working.
* Be careful when using the computers! This means no reckless or dangerous activities anywhere near a computer.
* Be respectful of others. This way, everyone gets to enjoy the program.

With that out of the way, let's begin!
