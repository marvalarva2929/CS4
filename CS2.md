=== HTML Basics - Continued ===

Do you remember what we did last class? Yes! We learned about how HTML works.

HTML is a tool used to create websites. You can use it to make any type of website that you want.
Writing in HTML is like writing words, except that with HTML, you use tags instead of words.

To tell a computer you want something in your website, you use tags. Different tags tell the computer to put different items.

For example, the "<img>" tag tells the computer to place an image, while the <p> tag tells the computer to place words.

Today, we are going to learn about the <img> tag, and start creating our websites!

The <img> tag places a picture on your webiste. The <img> tag requires two things: the tag, and the picture. You need to tell the computer to tell what picture to put, and where.

For example:
    <img src = "somewhere">

Tells the computer to place the picture that is in the folder "somewhere".

Today, you can take a picture of yourself, place it somewhere on your computer.
Then, you can try to place an image on a website by using the image tag. Remember to include where the image is located so that the computer knows where the picture is.

Be creative! You can add any picture you want, not just yourself. Try adding words by using the <p> tag.
If you need help, don't be afraid to ask!
