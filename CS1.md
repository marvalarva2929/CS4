=== HTML Basics ===

I'm sure you all have used webites before. www.youtube.com is a great example!
Youtube has something interesting for almost everyone. Think about what interests you. What do you like to watch on Youtube?

Youtube is just another one of many other websites. Websites are like online pictures or papers that you can visit using a computer.
Here are some more examples of websites:

*<https://www.nasa.gov/>
*<https://www.allenisd.org/>
*<https://wikipedia.org>

There are many websites that you can visit, each one for a different purpose.
Some websites are used for fun, some are used to teach people, and many others for other reasons.

Have you ever wondered how these websites are created? You can't build them using legos or clay, can you?
While you can't built a website using your hands, you can using a computer! All websites are created using a tool called "HTML"

HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language", but you don't need to remember that in order to build your own website.

All you need to know in order to make a website using HTML is tags. HTML tags are used to create parts of a webiste, like pictures and words.

Building a website is pretty hard, so the computer will do it for you. You only need to tell it what to do.
Tags are the way you can tell the the computer what you want. They tell the computer what to put on your website.

Here are some examples of tags:

*<p></p> - The paragraph tag. This adds words to your website
*<img></img> - The image tag. This adds pictures to your website

There are many more tags, all waiting for you to learn. Once you learn about them, you can use them to build your very own website.

But before that, we need a plan. Let's first draw on a sheat of paper what you want your website to look like. Try to be creative, and make it all about you!
